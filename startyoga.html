                <h1>Great, that's the first step.</h1>
                <p>Yoga, itself has been around for over 5000 years* with many poses, variations and teaching style.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> With this in mind, 3 poses have been selected that we feel would be for beneficial individuals
                    working
                    remotely. They are aimed to help relieve back, neck and leg pain and relieve stress that can
                    potentially come with work.</p>
